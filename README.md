# Electoral maps of France (2015)
This repo contains the code and the data to create value-by-alpha electoral maps of Dec. 2015 elections in France (regional election).

# Value-by-alpha maps
Value-by-alpha maps have been made popular by [Andy Woodruf from Axismaps](http://www.axismaps.com/blog/2008/11/a-new-kind-of-election-map/). You can read about the several ways to create this type of maps on [his blog](http://andywoodruff.com/blog/how-to-make-a-value-by-alpha-map/). I choose to create the maps using a slightly modified version of the D3 solution.

These maps have been published [in French](http://geographiesenmouvement.blogs.liberation.fr/2015/12/29/faire-plus-ou-moins-mentir-les-cartes-electorales/) and [in English]().
